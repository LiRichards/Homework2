    <h2>My Favorite Secret Spots, Walks, and Buildings on UNC Campus! by Lila Richardson</h2>
    <h3>I originally wanted to create a list of spots and buildings that I visit when I don't have class, but decided instead to list out all of my favorite areas to exist, chill, and hangout in when I'm out and about. For my vector piece, I found stream data from the city of Chapel Hill.</h3>
